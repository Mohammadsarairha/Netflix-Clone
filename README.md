# Netflix-Clone - ReactApp

## Creating a react App with NPM

- Create a directory for your project or clone an empty project you created from github

```bash
mkdir Netflix-Clone
```

- cd into your project

```bash
cd Netflix-Clone
```

- initialize a new npm project

```bash
npm init -y
```

- install the react dependencies to your project

```bash
npm i react react-dom react-scripts
```

- Create the react folder structure

```bash
mkdir public src
```

- Create the following files

```bash
touch public/index.html src/index.js src/App.jsx
```

- Now Open up the project with VS code.

```bash
code .
```

- open up `package.json` and add the following entry in the file

```json
"scripts":{
  "start": "react-scripts start"
}
```

- if you already find it in the file, just add the start script directly

```json
  "start": "react-scripts start"
```

- Open up the `index.html` in the `public` folder. Create a basic html template and add a `div` tag with `id='root'` in the body.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

- After that open the `index.js` in the `src` folder and add the following.

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

- In the `App.jsx` add a basic function component to test if the Application will run.

```js
import React from 'react';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello Pizza üçï World üëã</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- install React-Bootstrap is via the npm package .

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3
```

- The following line can be included in your src/index.js or App.js file

```js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```
- Install react-router-dom@6

```bash
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```
- Included in your src/index.js or App.js file
```js
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
```

- Import react route dom in src/App.js file

```js
import { Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";
```

- Back in your terminal make sure you are in the root of your project. Type `tree -I node_modules` and you should see the following:

```bash
‚ûú  project-name tree -I node_modules
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
```

- To test the project run the following command

```bash
npm start
```

- If you are running the project for the first time, you will be promoted this message

```bash
> project-name@1.0.0 start
> react-scripts start

## Steps to connect your app with server 

- Using the Fetch API

```js
fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

- When you try to run fetch first time you may to have this warning

```bash
Blocked by CORS policy: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'
```

- In server side you need to install cros 

```bash
npm install cors
```

- Defined cros in server.js file 

```js
var cors = require('cors')
app.use(cors());
```
